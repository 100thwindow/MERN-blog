🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
File Uploads: Multer (for images)








📝 Steps to Build
1️⃣ Set up the Backend (Express + MongoDB)

Connect MongoDB using Mongoose
Define models (User, BlogPost)
Set up routes (/api/posts, /api/auth)
2️⃣ Build the Frontend (React + React Router)

Create pages: Home, Create Post, Post Details, Login/Register
Use axios to call backend APIs
3️⃣ Implement Authentication (JWT + bcrypt.js)

Hash passwords, generate tokens
Protect routes with middleware
4️⃣ Add File Uploads (Multer)

Allow users to upload blog post images
5️⃣ Deploy the App (Render + Vercel)

Backend → Deploy on Render
Frontend → Deploy on Vercel
